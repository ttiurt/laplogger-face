# Lap Logger
Lap Logger is currently a website where fans of Formula 1 can post their opinions and ratings on recent races. Eventually the website will be molded into a place where you can log any race youâ€™ve watched, past or present, to your profile to keep track of races you may or may not want to rewatch down the road. The goal is to provide a site similar to Letterboxd or MyAnimeList for the fans of Formula 1.
